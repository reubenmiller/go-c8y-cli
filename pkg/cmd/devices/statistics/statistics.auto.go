There are no additional checks if the inventory object is marked as device using the c8y_IsDevice fragment. When the first measurement, event or alarm is created for a specific inventory object, Cumulocity IoT is always considering this as a device and starts counting.

Device statistics are counted with daily and monthly rate. All requests are considered when counting device statistics, no matter which processing mode is used.
