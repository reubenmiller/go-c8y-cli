  * [x] device expansion (if given an id, don't do a lookup)
  * [x] application
* [x] Support for ShouldProcess prompt
  * [x] Support device name lookup in the message?
* [x] Add tests
  * [x] How to automatic generate Pester tests
* [x] Use session default values (C8Y_TENANT for tenant path/query variables)
* [x] Change all Pester test files to use utf8 with BOM!! This is because Pester does not interpret the encoding of utf8 (no bom) files correctly, thus causing some encoding issues when testing!
Manual commands
* [x] Skip the tests which fail due to lack of access to a management tenant
    * [x] Add auto skip to the autogenerated tests
* [x] Restructure powershell module location in repo
* [x] Figure how to best package the c8y binary file/s with the powershell module
* [x] Adding encoding tests
* [x] Add aliases for all the commands, i.e. Get-ApplicationCollection -> apps, Get-DeviceCollection -> devices
* [x] Add device commands. New-Device, Update-Device, Remove-Device, Get-DeviceCollection (already exists)

* [ ] Client side filtering of results for those that don't support server side filters
  * [ ] Application
    * [ ] Name
* [ ] Remove child devices and child references by wildcard. Only delete matching children

## Packaging

* [x] Package c8y binary with the powershell app
* [x] Publish c8y binaries to github
* [x] Publish powershell module to PSGallery

* Installation problem with Windows 10. Requires PowerShellGet minimum version 2.2.3! Which is not installed by default on Windows 10 PS 5.1
    Maybe add recommendation that powershell 6 (core) should be used, also with an updated PowerShellGet
    https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/03/how-to-install-and-update-powershell-6/

    ```sh
    Install-Module PowerShellGet -Repository PSGallery -Force
    Install-Module PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2.2.3
    ```

## Docs

* [x] Write github pages with a tutorial
* [x] General concepts
    * [x] Dates
    * [x] Lookups
* [x] Setup
    * [x] Install binary

* [ ] Add/Remove child devices
* [ ] users (add, skip send email, or static password)
* [ ] managed objects
* [x] aliases
* [x] custom requests
* [x] Extending modules
* [ ] notifications

# Future

### Phase 2

* [x] Implement --all switch for collections to iterate through all results (max results)
* [ ] Make options case insensitive
* [ ] Look over devices where []device type is used (parallel tasks?) Probably need a new template

### Phase 3

* [ ] Cumulocity sessions
  * [ ] Store session credentials securely
  * [ ] Set credentials from a microservice subscription
