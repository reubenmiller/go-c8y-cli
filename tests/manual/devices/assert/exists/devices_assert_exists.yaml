tests:
    It filters a single id that does not exist:
        command:  c8y devices assert exists --not --device 1
        exit-code: 0
        stdout:
            exactly: '1'
    
    It fails the negated assertion when using dry mode:
        command:  c8y devices assert exists --not --device 1 --strict --dry
        exit-code: 112
    
    It fails the assertion when using dry mode:
        command:  c8y devices assert exists --device 1 --strict --dry
        exit-code: 112

    It filters a single id that does not exist (using pipeline):
        command: echo "1" | c8y devices assert exists --not
        exit-code: 0
        stdout:
            exactly: '1'
    
    It returns an error when a single id does not exist (single entry):
        command: echo "1" | c8y devices assert exists --strict
        exit-code: 112
    
    It filters multiple ids given in a list:
        command: echo "1\n2" | c8y devices assert exists --not
        exit-code: 0
        stdout:
            line-count: 2
            lines:
              1: '1'
              2: '2'

    It filters a list of json objects:
        command: >
          echo "{\"id\":\"1\"}" | c8y devices assert exists --not
        exit-code: 0
        stdout:
            json:
                id: '1'
    
    It asserts that a mo exists and passes it through untouched:
        command: manual/inventory/assert/exists/001_assert.sh
        exit-code: 0

    It return a non-zero exit code in strict mode when only 1 item does not exist:
        command: manual/inventory/assert/exists/002_assert.sh
        exit-code: 112
    
    It checks if a managed object exists, and then uses a downstream command to safely get a value:
        command: >
          echo "1" | c8y devices assert exists | c8y inventory get
        exit-code: 0

    It fails if an object exists but was expecting to not exist:
        command: >
          c8y inventory list --pageSize 1 | c8y devices assert exists --not --strict
        exit-code: 112

    It does not write to stderr when not using strict mode:
        command: >
          echo "0" | c8y devices assert exists
        exit-code: 0
        stderr:
            not-contains:
                - assertionError
    
    It writes errors to stderr when using strict mode:
        command: >
          echo "0" | c8y devices assert exists --strict
        exit-code: 112
        stderr:
            line-count: 1
            contains:
                - 'assertionError: managedObject - wanted: Found, got: NotFound, context'
