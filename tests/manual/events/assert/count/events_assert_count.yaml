    It returns an error when the device does not exist:
        command: c8y events assert count --device 1
        exit-code: 112
        stderr:
            line-count: 1
            contains:
                - '404'
    
    It returns an error when the device does not exist via name lookup:
        command: c8y events assert count --device unknown-device
        exit-code: 112
        stderr:
            line-count: 1
            contains:
                - 'unknown-device'
    
    It returns an error when the device does not exist (using pipeline):
        command: >
          echo "{\"id\":\"1\"}" | c8y events assert count --minimum 0
        exit-code: 112            
        stderr:
            line-count: 1
            contains:
                - '1'

    It supports dry run:
        command: c8y events assert count --device 1 --minimum 0 --dry
        exit-code: 0

    It asserts a device the has a minimum count:
        command: manual/events/assert/count/001_assert.sh
        exit-code: 0
