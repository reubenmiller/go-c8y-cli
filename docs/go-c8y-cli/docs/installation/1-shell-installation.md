## Installation

`go-c8y-cli` is available as a pre-built linux package which can be installed and updated via a package manager. Please following the instructions in your operating system.

It is recommended to install `go-c8y-cli` using a package manager as it makes it easier to update it in the future, and it will be available for all users.

After the installation, follow the instructions to [setup your shell profile](/docs/installation/shell-installation#setting-up-your-shell-profile).

:::warning WARNING 2022-01-10
The Linux repositories (Debian/Ubuntu/CentOs/RHEL/Fedora/Alpine) have been moved due to an issue with the previous hosting service.

The instructions have been updated to reflect the new url. Please remove any existing settings containing the string `https://reubenmiller.jfrog.io/artifactory` from your repository configuration and then repeat the installation instructions.
:::

### Debian / Ubuntu (apt)

1. Install the apt dependencies

    ```
    sudo apt-get install -y curl gnupg2 apt-transport-https
    ```

    :::note
    The command requires you to already have `sudo` installed. Most installations will have sudo by default so you don't need to do anything, however if you don't have it, install it via apt when running as a root user.
    :::

2. Configure the repository

    **Debian >=9 and Ubuntu >= 16.04**

    ```bash
    curl https://reubenmiller.github.io/go-c8y-cli-repo/debian/PUBLIC.KEY | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/go-c8y-cli-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
    sudo sh -c "echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/go-c8y-cli-archive-keyring.gpg] http://reubenmiller.github.io/go-c8y-cli-repo/debian stable main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list"
    ```

    :::note
    This step does not make use of `apt-key` as it has been deprecated. The gpg key is stored in an individual store only related to the go-c8y-cli repository, and it is linked via the apt.source settings using the `signed-by` property.
    :::

    **Debian <=8 and Ubuntu <= 14.04**

    ```bash
    curl https://reubenmiller.github.io/go-c8y-cli-repo/debian/PUBLIC.KEY | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo sh -c "echo 'deb https://reubenmiller.github.io/go-c8y-cli-repo/debian stable main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list"
    ```

        { label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell', },
    ]
    }>
    <TabItem value="bash">

    ```bash
    echo 'source "$(brew --prefix)/etc/go-c8y-cli/shell/c8y.plugin.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="zsh">

    ```bash
    echo 'source "$(brew --prefix)/etc/go-c8y-cli/shell/c8y.plugin.zsh"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="fish">

    ```bash

    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

4. Restart your shell to reload your profile

:::note
You can also view the instructions on how to source the relevant plugin via the command `brew info go-c8y-cli`
:::

### Manually (via script)

:::info
The install script currently requires you to have `jq` installed. `jq` is a cli json parsing tool which is recommended to have anyways to do complex json manipulations that you might need during your daily use of `c8y`.

See the [jq website](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) for details how to install it on your operating system.
:::

`go-c8y-cli` can also be installed by cloning a git repository and running an install script. It will install the latest binary and add the plugin script to your shell profile.

This method does not require sudo rights, however the binary will be located inside your user's home folder.

1. Clone the addons repository containing the install script, views and some example templates.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/reubenmiller/go-c8y-cli-addons.git ~/.go-c8y-cli
    ```

2. Install go-c8y-cli binary

    ```bash
    ~/.go-c8y-cli/install.sh
    ```

3. Add the installation path to your `PATH` variable (ideally in your shell profile)

    <Tabs
    groupId="shell-types"
    defaultValue="bash"
    values={[
        { label: 'Bash', value: 'bash', },
        { label: 'Zsh', value: 'zsh', },
        { label: 'Fish', value: 'fish', },
    ]
    }>
    <TabItem value="bash">

    ```bash title="file: ~/.bashrc"
    export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="zsh">

    ```bash title="file: ~/.zshrc"
    export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="fish">

    ```bash title="file: ~/.config/fish/config.fish"
    set -gx PATH "$HOME/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Reload your shell, or source your profile directly, i.e. bash: `source ~/.bashrc`

4. Verify that the `c8y` binary is executable and can be found on the command line 

    ```bash
    which c8y
    ```

    ```text title="Output"
    /home/myuser/bin/c8y
    ```

    :::tip
    Try closing your console and re-opening it so you can be sure that your setup will work next time

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
If you don't import the plugin script, then you will have to use the following to set your session:

<Tabs
  groupId="shell-types"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Bash', value: 'bash', },
    { label: 'Zsh', value: 'zsh', },

    { label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

eval $(c8y sessions set --shell bash)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="zsh">

```bash
eval $(c8y sessions set --shell zsh)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fish">

```bash
c8y sessions set --shell fish | source
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
c8y sessions set --shell powershell | out-string | Invoke-Expression
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Other recommended tools

### jq

Since the output of the c8y cli tool is mainly json, it is highly recommended that you install the json cli tool `jq` to help formatting the output.

#### Example: Get the id of each devices from a query

```bash
c8y devices list --select id

# Or csv output using
c8y devices list --select id --output csvheader
```

If you are more familiar with the popular `jq` tool, then you can use it to extract information that you need.

```bash
c8y devices list | jq -r ".id"
```

## Getting started

After `go-c8y-cli` has been installed, follow the [Getting started](/docs/gettingstarted/) section for instructions how to use it.
